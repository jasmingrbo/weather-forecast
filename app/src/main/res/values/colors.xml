    <!-- For whatever reason this color must not contain transparency, otherwise "the color" behind
    it gets to be shown, even though there should be no color behind it... Works fine with
     transparency when set programmatically in the activity. But if we try to set values before
     keyboard was ever shown it doesn't get acknowledged, therefore we have to set it over here
     without transparency. -->
